Model Performance: Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~92.73% Random Forest Accuracy: ~95.87% Which Model Performed Better? The Random Forest model outperformed the Logistic Regression model with an accuracy of 95.87% compared to the Logistic Regression model’s accuracy of 92.73%. This suggests that the Random Forest model was better at distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.

How Does That Compare to My Prediction? If you predicted that the Random Forest model would perform better, this aligns with the results. Random Forest models tend to perform better in complex classification tasks like spam detection due to their ensemble nature. They aggregate the results from multiple decision trees, making them robust to overfitting and capable of capturing more complex patterns in the data compared to Logistic Regression.

However, Logistic Regression, despite being a simpler model, still performed quite well, indicating that the dataset is not overly complex and that linear decision boundaries were sufficient to achieve reasonably high accuracy.

Conclusion: Based on this evaluation, the Random Forest model is the better choice for improving the ISP’s email filtering system, as it provides higher accuracy and is more likely to catch a greater number of spam emails.
